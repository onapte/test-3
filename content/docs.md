## What is HAWA-ON?
HAWA-ON is a free platform which provides weather data in the form of tables and maps. We are not limited to just tables and maps. We also provide Satellite images and Radars courtesy to IMD. Our services can be useful for pilots, meterologists and many others.    

## Our Services
1. Table-view    
The **Table-view** page provides a tabular representation of latest weather data sourced by **IMD**. The green entry corresponds to safe weather for flying, yellow entry corresponds to unstable weather for flying and red entry corresponds to dangerous weather for flying. For example, if the airport is "Agartala" and it is a red entry then the weather in Agartala is dangerous for flying.
